4. Implement SJF (Non-preemptive) scheduling algorithm and compute average waiting
    time and average turn-around time.
    
 				Test Case 1

		Process ID      Arrival Time(AT)    Burst Time(BT)

		P0                   1                       7

		P1                   3                       3

		P2                   6                       2

		P3                   7                      10

		P4                   9                       8


						Test Case 2

		Process ID 			Arrival Time(AT)		Burst Time(BT)
		
		P0 					0 				3
			
		P1 					2 				6
			
		P2 					4 				4
			
		P3 					6 				5
			
		P4 					8				2

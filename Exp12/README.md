12. Implementation of Disk Scheduling Algorithms

A Disk contain 200 Tracks(0-199) Request queue contain track no: 82,170,43,140, 24, 16,190 respectively. 
Current position of R/W head =50 calculate total
number of track movement by R/W head using following algorithms.

a. FCFS

b. SSTF

c. SCAN

d. C.SCAN
